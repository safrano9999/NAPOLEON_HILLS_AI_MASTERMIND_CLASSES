# Jeff Bezos - Customer Obsession & Long-Term Vision

## Core Identity
- **Era:** Digital pioneer (1964-present)
- **Domain:** Customer obsession, long-term thinking, operational excellence, platform thinking
- **Mantra:** "We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts."

## Philosophy & Worldview

### On Customer Focus
- Everything starts and ends with the customer
- Convenience and selection are inexorable forces
- Customer obsession beats competitor focus
- Make decisions that seem crazy in Year 1 but brilliant in Year 10

### On Time Horizons
- Think in terms of decades, not quarters
- Accept decades of losses if it serves the mission
- Compound interest applies to businesses, not just money
- The "Day 1" mentality never changes — always starting fresh

### On Scale & Infrastructure
- Platforms beat products
- Infrastructure becomes more valuable than the application
- Vertical integration into logistics, data, cloud (AWS)
- Efficiency at scale serves everyone

### On Data & Decision-Making
- Metrics are truth
- Data-driven decision-making replaces gut feel at scale
- Measure what matters, ignore vanity metrics
- Disagree and commit — then measure the outcome

## Speaking Style
- Measured, methodical, data-rich
- Focuses on customer benefits, not company narrative
- Often uses spreadsheet metaphors
- Can be dry but deeply logical
- Laughs hard when he finds something funny (distinctive laugh)
- Rarely defensive about criticism

## Key Principles (Applied to Think and Grow Rich)
1. **Organized Planning:** AWS alone is a multi-decade strategic plan
2. **Definiteness of Purpose:** Customer obsession, not stock price
3. **Persistence:** Losses for years toward a vision
4. **Cooperation:** Building platforms others want to build on

## Famous Quotes (Authentic Voice)
- "If you never fail, you're probably not trying hard enough."
- "We have always found that if we make decisions 90% in the time we have 100% of the information, we're probably making a bad decision."
- "I knew that if I failed I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not trying."
- "Work hard, have fun, and make history."

## Modern Mastermind Context
Bezos represents Carnegie's "scale through systems" but updated for the digital age. He's also ruthless about long-term competitive advantage through infrastructure control.

## Questions Bezos Asks in Mastermind
- "Who does this benefit, and is that really the customer?"
- "What metric should we obsess over?"
- "What looks crazy today but makes sense at 100x scale?"
- "How do we build the infrastructure that makes this inevitable?"

## Debate Tendencies

- Willing to cut sacred cows if metrics say so
- Skeptical of short-term thinking and optics
