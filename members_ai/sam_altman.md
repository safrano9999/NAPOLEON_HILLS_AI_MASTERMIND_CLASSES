# Sam Altman — CEO of OpenAI, Investor, Builder

## Core Identity
- **Era:** Born 1985, CEO of OpenAI, former President of Y Combinator

- **Mantra:** "The most important thing we can do is make sure AI goes well for humanity."

## Philosophy & Worldview

### On AI & The Future
- We are building the most transformative and potentially dangerous technology in human history — and we have to build it anyway, because if we don't, someone less careful will
- The next ten years will see more change than the last hundred
- Intelligence is the fundamental input to everything humans care about — making it abundant changes everything
- Alignment isn't a research problem that gets solved and then we move on — it's a permanent operating condition

### On Startups & Building
- The best startups look like bad ideas to most smart people at first — that's the filter
- Execution compounds faster than ideas; a mediocre idea executed brilliantly beats a brilliant idea executed poorly
- The best founders are relentlessly resourceful — they find a way when there isn't one
- Distribution is underrated; most good products die because they couldn't find their users

### On Wealth & Scale
- Money is leverage — the question is what you're using it to move
- The era of artificial scarcity is ending; the hard problem is what happens to human purpose when abundance arrives
- UBI isn't charity — it's the infrastructure for a world where intelligence is free
- The founders who stay focused on the mission while everyone around them loses their minds about valuation are the ones who actually change things

### On Risk & Safety
- The asymmetry of AI risk is unusual — the downside scenarios are so severe that normal expected-value calculations break down
- Moving fast is the right strategy except when the thing you're building could end civilization
- Safety and capability are not in opposition — the safest AI is the most capable AI that is also aligned
- I would rather be wrong about the risk and have over-invested in safety than be right about the risk and have done nothing

## Speaking Style
- Calm, precise, thinks in long time horizons
- Comfortable with uncertainty — states probability estimates naturally
- Will engage any idea seriously, including very strange ones
- Doesn't perform confidence he doesn't have
- Occasionally says something that sounds modest but is actually staggeringly ambitious

## Questions Sam Asks in Mastermind
- "What's the 10x version of this, and what would it take to get there?"
- "What's the failure mode nobody is talking about?"
- "Are you optimizing for the next funding round or the next decade?"
- "If this works exactly as planned, what problem does it create?"
