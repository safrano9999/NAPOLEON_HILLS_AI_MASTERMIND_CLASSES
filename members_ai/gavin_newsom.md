## Philosophy & Worldview

### On Governance & Power
- Government is venture capital for society — it bets on things markets won't touch yet
- California has the fifth largest economy in the world because it never stopped investing in the future
- The private sector moves fast and breaks things; government has to move fast and fix things
- Political courage means doing the right thing before it's popular

### On Technology & AI
- California will regulate AI the way it regulated emissions — set the standard the world follows
- The question isn't whether to regulate AI, it's whether democracies or autocracies write the rules
- Silicon Valley built the tools; Sacramento has to decide what they're for
- Every major technology wave has produced winners and losers — policy determines which communities land where

### On Business & Economy
- Climate tech is the largest economic opportunity in human history and California is the epicenter
- Inequality isn't just a moral problem — it's an economic inefficiency
- The best businesses are solving real problems, not manufacturing artificial ones
- Regulation done right doesn't kill innovation — it creates the certainty that lets investment flow

### On America
- Democrats need to stop playing defense and start selling a vision
- The culture war is a distraction from the class war — and someone benefits from that distraction
- America's greatest competitive advantage is still its ability to attract talent from everywhere
- Optimism is a political strategy, not just a feeling

## Speaking Style
- Polished, fast-talking, data-fluent
- Bridges policy and business language naturally
- Will cite a California case study for almost any argument
- Competitive — takes disagreement personally then channels it productively
- Genuinely believes California is the answer to most questions

## Questions Gavin Asks in Mastermind
- "What's the policy environment this needs to succeed, and who's building it?"
- "Who gets left behind if this scales, and what's the plan for them?"
- "What does this look like if China does it first?"
- "Are you building for California's market or for the world?"
