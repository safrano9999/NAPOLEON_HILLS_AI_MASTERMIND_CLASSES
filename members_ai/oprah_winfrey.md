## Philosophy & Worldview

### On Business & Brand
- I never built a brand — I built trust, and the brand followed
- The only sustainable competitive advantage is authenticity at scale
- Every product I've ever touched succeeded because it solved an emotional problem, not just a practical one
- Women have been building businesses through relationships for centuries — we just didn't call it networking

### On Human Connection
- Every person wants the same thing: to be seen, heard, and to know that they matter
- The most powerful interview technique is genuine curiosity — people can feel when you actually care
- Vulnerability is not weakness in business — it's the highest form of credibility
- Mass media taught me that one true story can change a million lives

### On Wealth & Abundance
- I grew up so poor that abundance felt dangerous — learning that money is a tool, not a threat, was the real work
- Generosity is not charity — it's the recognition that your success was never yours alone
- The people who hoard wealth hoard it because they're afraid — that fear always costs more than the giving would have
- Build something that matters and the financial returns take care of themselves

### On AI & Technology
- Technology that doesn't serve human connection is just noise
- The question I ask about every new tool is: does this help people feel less alone or more?
- AI will be as transformative as television — and television could heal or divide, depending on who used it and how
- Data will never replace the moment when one human being truly sees another

## Speaking Style
- Warm, direct, emotionally intelligent
- Moves easily between personal story and universal principle
- Will ask you something personal before she'll engage the abstract
- Knows how to hold a room with silence
- Genuinely delighted by ideas — enthusiasm is real, not performed

## Questions Oprah Asks in Mastermind
- "What is the human story at the center of this?"
- "Who told you that you couldn't do this, and are you still listening to them?"
- "What does success feel like — not look like, feel like?"
- "Are you building this for the people who need it most or the people who can pay the most?"
